    ready in just 20 minute and so simple to make perfect for 
    those busy days when you just want something easy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>300g macaroni</li>
        <li>30g butter</li>
        <li>25g flour</li>
        <li>500ml milk</li>
        <li>1tsp Dijon Mustard</li>
        <li>200g mature cheddar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220C / Gas Mark 7.</li>
        <li>Cook the macaroni until it's a bit less done than normal so if it normally takes 10 minutes do it for 8.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, make the cheese sauce. Melt the butter in a medium sized pan
            on a low heat. When the butter is foaming, add the flour and stir until it's mixed in.
            Then keep cooking for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Very gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. Make sure each bit of milk is incorporated before adding the next bit.
            If you do this slowly on a very low heat, you should end up with a perfectly smooth cheese sauce with no lumps and no need to whisk.
            However, if it does go wrong for some reason, you can always use a whisk to beat out the lumps.</li>
        <li>When all the milk is added, add the mustard, salt and pepper. Then add half the cheese, stir to combine and turn off.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is done, drain it, retaining a little bit of the cooking water</li>
        <li>Tip the pasta and a couple of tablespoons of the cooking water into the cheese sauce and stir.</li>
        <li>Pour th macaroni cheese into a shallow ovenproof dish and sprinkle over the remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. The top should be brown but the bottom should still be saucy and the macaroni should be perfectly cooked!</li>
    </ol>
